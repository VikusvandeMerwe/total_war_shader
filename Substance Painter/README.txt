This package includes the Total War Shader and a Substance template to use the shader properly.
Please follow the instructions to install the shader and the template.

The Total War Shader is a complete translation of the HLSL shader for 3ds Max provided in the
official Assembly Kit of Total War: Attila. Together with the Substance template you will be
able to create textures which fit into the engine of Total War: Attila perfectly. It allows the
developer to preview and fine-tune the textures directly in Substance Painter. All functionalities
are supported.

This package includes the Total War Shader and a Substance template to use the shader properly.
Please follow the instructions to install the shader and the template.

The Total War Shader is a complete translation of the HLSL shader for 3ds Max provided in the
official Assembly Kit of Total War: Attila. Together with the Substance template you will be
able to create textures which fit into the engine of Total War: Attila perfectly. It allows the
developer to preview and fine-tune the textures directly in Substance Designer. All functionalities
are supported.

 1.4	Paste the files from the "Shader" folder there.

2.
 2.1	Go back to the Total War Shader Package root.
 2.2	Copy the .sbs file and the resource folder in "Template".
 2.3	Create a folder somewhere on your computer and paste the files into that folder.
	This folder should be placed there permanently so that it remains accessible by
	Substance Designer.

 2.5	Go to "Tools" -> "Preferences".
 2.6	Click on the "Projects" tab on the left side.

You should now be able to create a new Substance with the Total War template. To apply the
Total War shader in the 3D viewport, go to "Materials" -> "Default" (may also be a mesh name)
-> "Definitions" and then you can select "physically_total_war".
Check out the "Channels" tab to disable or enable textures.
